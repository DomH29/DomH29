# 👋 Hi, I'm Dominik Holt!  

🔹 **Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional | IT Production Support | Security Monitoring & Incident Response**  

I’m a dedicated IT and cybersecurity enthusiast actively **seeking my first role in cybersecurity**. With hands-on experience in **incident management, security monitoring, and log analysis**, I have built a strong foundation in **Splunk, SIEM tools, Unix/Linux systems, and cloud security**. My goal is to leverage my skills to protect digital assets, detect threats, and ensure system stability.  

## 💡 What I Bring to the Table  
- **Security Monitoring & Incident Response** – Detecting threats and analyzing security logs with Splunk, SIEM, and ELK Stack.  
- **System Administration & Automation** – Managing Unix/Linux environments, scripting in Bash & PowerShell, and troubleshooting.  
- **Cloud Security & DevSecOps** – Securing cloud environments using AWS, GCP, Terraform, and security automation tools.  
- **Database & Data Security** – Conducting SQL-based security analysis, encryption, and event correlation.  

## 🎯 Actively Seeking My First Cybersecurity Role  
I am eager to apply my knowledge and hands-on experience to a **SOC Analyst, Security Analyst, or IT Security Support** position. I'm passionate about learning, staying up-to-date with emerging threats, and contributing to a strong security posture for an organization.  

## 📌 Certifications & Training  
✔️ **CompTIA Security+**

✔️ **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**  
✔️ **Columbia University Cybersecurity Certificate**  

## 🚀 Projects & Contributions  
- Developed **Splunk dashboards** for real-time security monitoring and custom alerting.  
- Built automation scripts for **log parsing & infrastructure performance monitoring**.  
- Conducted **penetration testing** and implemented security hardening for Unix-based systems.

## 🚀 Projects

🛠️ Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis on Linux

In this project, I used **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network packets on a Linux system. I successfully installed and configured Wireshark, captured packets on a detected interface, and applied **filters** to observe specific protocols, detect a target IP address, and locate certain packets. This project enhanced my understanding of **network traffic monitoring, TCP/IP protocols, and security analysis**.  

**🔹 Tools Used:** Wireshark, Linux, TCP/IP, Display & Conditional Filters  
**🔹 Key Learnings:** Packet analysis, filtering techniques, and detecting anomalies  
**🔹 Next Steps:** Automate packet analysis with Python, explore TLS decryption, and apply insights to security monitoring.
